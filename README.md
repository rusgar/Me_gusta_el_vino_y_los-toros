It is a pleasant tasting alcoholic beverage, loved cellebrated . It will definitely be interesting to analyze the physicochemical attributes of wine and understand their relationships and significance with wine quality and types classifications. To do this, We will proceed according to the standard Machine Learning and data workflow models like the TPOT API model and devlop an app mainly for:
The data science workflow is a non-linear and iterative task which requires many skills and tools to cover the whole process. From framing your business problem to generating actionable insights. It includes following steps
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Collection
3. Data Preparation
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Modeling
6. Model evaluation
7. Deployment
